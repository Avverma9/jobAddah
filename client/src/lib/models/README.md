# Models

This folder contains placeholder model files. Implement them with your chosen database/ORM.

Suggestions:

- For Prisma: create `prisma/schema.prisma` and use `src/lib/db.js` to export a Prisma client.
- For MongoDB: use `mongodb` or `mongoose` and implement `connect()` in `src/lib/db.js`.

Files:

- `job.js` — Job model CRUD stubs
- `user.js` — User model CRUD stubs
